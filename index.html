                              Now that you have a Git repository configured as a working point for developers to share their code, 
                              and you also know the basic Git commands to use locally, you will see how you can use some of the
                              distributed workflows that Git allows.
                            </p>
                           <p> In this chapter, you will see how to work with Git in a distributed environment as a contributor or integrator.
                              That is, you will learn how to properly contribute to a project, easily for both you and the person in charge of
                               the project, and also how to properly maintain a project with multiple developers.
